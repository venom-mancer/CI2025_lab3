# CI2025 Lab 3: Shortest Path Finding Algorithms

This project implements and compares three fundamental shortest path algorithms **POSITIVE VALUE ONLY**: **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**, and **A\* Search Algorithm**. The implementation uses NetworkX for graph representation and provides comprehensive tracking of algorithm behavior including frontier exploration, nodes explored, path costs, and execution status.

## Project Structure

- **`short_path_finding.py`**: Core implementation of the three shortest path algorithms with frontier tracking
- **`lab3_shortest_paths_demo.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating algorithm usage, comparison, and visualization

## Problem Overview

The goal is to find the shortest path between two randomly selected cities (nodes) in a weighted directed graph. The graph is generated with configurable parameters:
- **Size**: Number of cities/nodes (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)
- **Density**: Probability of edge existence between any two nodes (0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0)
- **Noise Level**: Random variation added to edge weights (0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8)
- **Negative Values**: Whether to allow negative edge weights (affects algorithm selection like bellman ford)

## How the Problem Solving Works

### 1. Graph Generation (`lab3_shortest_paths_demo.ipynb`)

The `create_problem()` function generates a random graph:

1. **City Coordinates**: Each city is assigned random 2D coordinates in [0,1]×[0,1]
2. **Edge Creation**: For each pair of cities (i, j), an edge is created with probability `density`
3. **Edge Weight Calculation**: 
   - Base distance = Euclidean distance between city coordinates
   - Noise is added: `weight = base_distance + noise`
   - If `negative_values=True`, noise can be negative (range: [-noise_level, +noise_level])
   - If `negative_values=False`, noise is non-negative (range: [0, noise_level])
4. **Graph Construction**: The cost matrix is converted to a NetworkX `DiGraph` using `build_graph_from_matrix()`

### 2. City Selection

Two cities are randomly selected using:
- **Dynamic Seeding**: Uses `time.time()` to ensure different results on each run or we can use `rng = np.random.default_rng()`
- **Random Shuffling**: The node list is shuffled for display purposes
- **Unique Selection**: Two distinct nodes are chosen using `rng.choice(nodes, size=2, replace=False)`

### 3. Algorithm Execution

All three algorithms are run on the same source-target pair, and their results are compared:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to explore nodes in order of increasing distance from source
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Relaxes all edges up to |V|-1 times to find shortest paths
- **A\* Algorithm**: Uses Dijkstra-like exploration guided by a heuristic function (Euclidean distance to target)

## Algorithm Mechanisms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm (`dijkstra_with_frontier`)

**How it works:**
1. Initialize distance to source as 0, all other nodes as ∞
2. Maintain a priority queue (min-heap) of nodes to explore, ordered by distance
3. Repeatedly:
   - Pop the node with minimum distance from the queue
   - Add it to the frontier (list of explored nodes)
   - If it's the target, stop
   - For each neighbor, if a shorter path is found, update distance and add to queue

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Greedy**: Always explores the closest unvisited node first
- **Optimal**: Guarantees shortest path for non-negative edge weights
- **Efficient**: Typically explores fewer nodes than Bellman-Ford
- **Limitation**: Cannot handle negative edge weights

**Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm (`bellman_ford_with_frontier`)

**How it works:**
1. Initialize distance to source as 0, all other nodes as ∞
2. Relax all edges up to |V|-1 times:
   - For each edge (u, v) with weight w: if `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`, update `dist[v]`
3. Check for negative cycles: if any edge can still be relaxed, a negative cycle exists
4. Reconstruct path using predecessor array

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Systematic**: Examines all edges in each iteration
- **Robust**: Handles negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstra)
- **Complete**: Can detect negative cycles
- **Less Efficient**: Typically explores more nodes than Dijkstra or A\*

**Time Complexity**: O(V × E)

### A\* Algorithm (`astar_with_frontier`)

**How it works:**
1. Uses a priority queue ordered by `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` where:
   - `g(n)` = actual cost from source to node n
   - `h(n)` = heuristic estimate from node n to target (Euclidean distance)
2. Similar to Dijkstra, but prioritizes nodes that appear closer to the target
3. The heuristic guides exploration toward the target, reducing unnecessary exploration

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Informed Search**: Uses heuristic to guide exploration
- **Optimal**: Guarantees shortest path if heuristic is admissible (never overestimates)
- **Efficient**: Typically explores fewer nodes than Dijkstra due to heuristic guidance
- **Limitation**: Requires non-negative edge weights and an admissible heuristic

**Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) (same as Dijkstra, but with better constant factors)

## Why Does Bellman-Ford Explore More Nodes?

Bellman-Ford explores more nodes than Dijkstra and A\* for several reasons:

### 1. **Systematic Edge Relaxation**
- **Bellman-Ford**: In each iteration, it examines **all edges** in the graph, regardless of whether they lead to promising paths
- **Dijkstra/A\***: Only explore edges from nodes that are already known to be on promising paths (via the priority queue)

### 2. **No Early Termination for Target**
- **Bellman-Ford**: Must complete up to |V|-1 iterations to guarantee correctness, even if the target is found early
- **Dijkstra/A\***: Can terminate immediately when the target is popped from the priority queue (guaranteed to be optimal)

### 3. **Exploration Strategy**
- **Bellman-Ford**: Uses a "relaxation" approach that may update the same node multiple times across iterations
- **Dijkstra/A\***: Uses a "greedy" approach that explores nodes in order of increasing cost, avoiding redundant exploration

### 4. **Frontier Tracking Difference**
- **Bellman-Ford's frontier**: Contains nodes whose distances were updated (may include duplicates across iterations)
- **Dijkstra/A\*'s frontier**: Contains nodes that were actually popped and explored (no duplicates)

**In Summary**: Bellman-Ford trades efficiency for generality—it can handle negative weights and detect cycles, but pays the cost of exploring more of the graph systematically.

##  Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Edge Weights | Negative Cycles | Typical Nodes Explored | Best Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Dijkstra** | Non-negative only | Cannot detect | Medium | Dense graphs, non-negative weights |
| **Bellman-Ford** | Any (including negative) | Can detect | High | Sparse graphs, negative weights possible |
| **A\*** | Non-negative only | Cannot detect | Low | When good heuristic available |


### Customizing Parameters

In the notebook, modify these parameters in the second cell:

```python
size = 200              # Number of cities
density = 1.0           # Edge probability (0.0 to 1.0)
noise_level = 0.5       # Random noise added to edge weights
negative_values = False # Allow negative edge weights
```
